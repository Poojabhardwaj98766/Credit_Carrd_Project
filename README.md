# Credit_Card_Project

Project Objective 
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

My Approach:

Data Extraction with SQL:
I utilized MySQL to run queries and pull the necessary data related to credit card transactions. This enabled me to answer specific business questions using the company's database.

Data Visualization:
I leveraged Power BI to create interactive and easy-to-understand visualizations, such as transaction trends, spending categories, and customer demographics. These insights made the data actionable and understandable for the management.

Presentation Design:
I designed an engaging and professional PowerPoint presentation, tailored for top-level management. The presentation focused on the key insights and actionable recommendations derived from the analysis.

Actionable Insights:
I provided insights on trends in customer spending, seasonal variations, and fraud patterns. These insights would assist management in making data-informed decisions to improve strategies and operations.

Outcome:
This project demonstrated my ability to manage complex data queries, extract relevant information, and present it in a compelling way. It also helped me refine my skills in SQL, data visualization, and business communication, all of which are essential for data-driven decision-making in the corporate world.
